# 11U-Compsci-Culminating-Project

This was my final project for my grade 11 computer science course!

The Knight Quest follows the story of a knight whose princess has been kidnapped by an evil wizard, so he sets on a journey to save her. The game had multiple levels which different styles of gameplay, mazes and platformers. Throughout the entire game, you have to fight off enemies and as you progress, the difficulty increases with faster enemies that deal more damage. There are power ups to help you move faster and deal more damage to enemies. The storyline is told through little cutscenes between each of the levels. Along the way, you gain a flying friend who helps you on your adventures.

I learned a lot of the pygame-zero python library and the basics of coding from doing this project. I also learned how to handle files and orgnaize them, especially when it came to uploading images and sounds. There are minor bugs throughout the game, as I had limited to work on this.

# Running the Code

If you want to play the game, upload the zip file to any python IDE and install the pygame-zero library.
